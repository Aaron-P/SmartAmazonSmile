Due to [Amazon Smile being discontinued](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/amazon-closing-amazonsmile-to-focus-its-philanthropic-giving-to-programs-with-greater-impact) this extension will no longer be maintained and will be removed from the Firefox addon repository after February 20th, 2023.

***

This extension will automatically redirect Amazon store pages on [Amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com/), [Amazon.co.uk](https://www.amazon.co.uk/), and [Amazon.de](https://www.amazon.de/) to the corresponding Amazon Smile version if you are logged in.  Unlike similar extensions it will not attempt to redirect to Amazon Smile if you are not logged in, preventing you from being constantly prompted to log in.
