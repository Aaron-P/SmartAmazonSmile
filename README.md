This extension will automatically redirect Amazon store pages on [Amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com/), [Amazon.co.uk](https://www.amazon.co.uk/), and [Amazon.de](https://www.amazon.de/) to the corresponding Amazon Smile version if you are logged in.  Unlike similar extensions it will not attempt to redirect to Amazon Smile if you are not logged in, preventing you from being constantly prompted to log in.
